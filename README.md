# SALARY ANALYSIS ðŸ“Š

## WELCOME!

In this project I have learned how to perform a salary analysis with fictitious information, however being able to apply mathematics and basic statistics combined with Javascript has made me go beyond my logical thinking, solving percentage problems in which I create discount coupons to apply it to products and reduce their prices, Formulas to take out the perimeter and area of geometric figures, determine the average, median and mode that later helped me determine a salary projection per person, restructure the information to get a salary projection by companies and a top 10% of the highest salaries.
